Pycharm setup

1. Created project myapp

2. Created application app

3. Make sure, manage.py have following setting:   os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "app.settings")

4. urls.py contains all the urls
   Following is a sample:

from django.conf.urls import url

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'myapp/', views.homepage, name='home'),
]

   So, whey somebody hits:  http://localhost:port/myapp => django executes the function views -> homepage()
   You can give any name instead of 'home'

5. views.py contains functions corresponding to views

6. models.py contains all the model classes

7. Changed settings.py to talk to mysql database

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'mysql.connector.django',
        'NAME': 'myapp',
        'USER': 'root',
        'PASSWORD': 'root',
        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
        'PORT': '3307'
    }
}

Here 'NAME' is the name of database, intentionally changed 'PORT' to 3307 as I already had another mysql at 3306

8. Started development server from:  Tools -> Run manage.py Task -> run server

    Now, we can run our application at:   http://localhost:8000/myapp

9. After creating model classes in models.py, on command prompt, in the 'myapp' directory, executed following command:
   python manage.py makemigrations

   This will create tables in database corresponding to models
